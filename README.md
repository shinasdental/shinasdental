We began our career as dental professional in 1999 at Shinas Dental Clinic in Azaiba. Soon after, we expanded our services to Ghubra, Mawelah, Azaiba (Second Branch) and Al Khoud in order to meet the needs and convenience of our patients.

In our 24 Years of experience we have provided an unparalleled experience for more than 400000 patients with beautiful Smiles and contentmentâ€™s. We have always maintained a friendly atmosphere and patients are treated with compassion.

We offer 365 days excellent care, best service at affordable cost.

We have an excellent team of highly skilled and qualified professionals in various specialties including orthodontics (Braces), Endodontics (Root Canal), Implantology (Teeth Fixing), Cosmetology (Smile Make Over), Laser (Gum Contouring and shaping), and general dentistry. We also have our own Dental Laboratory facility which offers the state of art dental prosthesis for our patients.

All of our clinics are equipped with cutting-edge technology and equipment to provide better diagnosis and treatment.
